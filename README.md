# ðŸ“± Lifecycle Logger App(Jetpack Compose Activity Lifecycle)

This is a simple Android app that shows how the **Activity Lifecycle** works using **Jetpack Compose**.

When the app starts, stops, resumes, or gets destroyed, the app will:

âœ… Show which lifecycle methods are called  
âœ… Display a toast message  
âœ… Show the events on the screen  

## How It Works

Each time a lifecycle method is called, we:

1. Add the event to a list  
2. Show it on the screen  
3. Show a small Toast  
4. Print it in Logcat


## Example Lifecycle Flow
| Action                  | Events Triggered                          |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| App starts              | onCreate â†’ onStart â†’ onResume             |
| App goes to background  | onPause â†’ onStop                          |
| App comes back          | onRestart â†’ onStart â†’ onResume            |
| App is closed           | onPause â†’ onStop â†’ onDestroy              |
